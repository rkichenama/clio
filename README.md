...an application that can allow a user to find jobs. This will leverage [https://www.themuse.com/developers](themuse public-facing API). You should put this up on github with a README explaining how to get the app up and running. We recommend that you apply some filters so you can get a smaller sampling of job listings so that you can test and demo your application easily. There is no need to pull back all available positions from our API for the purposes of this assignment.

You should timebox this to 4-6 hours.

**Note**: We already have a job search and this code will never be used in production. This is meant to simulate something you would be doing in your day-to-day job here at The Muse.

* The job search listing should be filterable by company, level, location, and job category, a user should be able to filter on multiple values and multiple facets
* Clicking the job title to be able to see the full details of a specific position
* The user should be able to link to The Muse’s job posting
